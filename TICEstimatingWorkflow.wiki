= TIC Estimating/APEX Workflow =

1. Engineering disciplines prepare their project services estimate in the PSE Tool and procured equipment in APEX.

2. Estimators prepare the Field Cost estimate in the TIC Estimating Tool.

3. When ready, the Cost Engineer imports the PSE into the TIC Estimating Tool.

4. Prior to IFR, the estimate is locked (CLOSED) in the TIC Estimating Tool.

5. The estimate goes IFR to the client.

6. If revisions are needed, a new estimate REVISION is created in the TIC Estimating Tool.

7. Revisions are incorporated into the newly-created revision.

8. Cost Engineer verifies that MR Groups are assigned; (disciplines own this, Cost Engineer just verifies that they are there.)

9. Prior to IFA , the revised estimate is locked (CLOSED) in the TIC Estimating Tool.

10. The estimate goes IFA to the client.

11. Cost Engineer PUBLISHES the estimate to APEX.

12. Revisions after IFA are via Change Management Process.

Once imported into APEX, the disciplines must create a new MR for each MR Group to establish need-by dates.
