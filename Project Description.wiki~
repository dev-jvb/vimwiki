The Nuna Drillsite 1 (NDS-1) project will construct a new drillsite for Pioneer Natural Resources on the edge of the Colville River Delta, six miles west of the Oooguruk Tie-in Pad on the Alaskan North Slope. Project scope includes infrastructure to support one disposal well, 25 production wells, and 25 injection wells.  The boundaries of this project are between the surface safety valves on the production/injection well trees and the flow line tie-ins at the edge of the drill pad.  The wells are arranged in one straight line and are connected via a standard trunk and lateral piping configuration. The primary production mode of the wells is via electric submersible pumps (ESPs), with lift gas as a backup.  Well row headers and lateral connections will be provided for production, test, water injection, lift gas, corrosion inhibitor, and scale inhibitor.  Process modules will be provided for chemical injection, pigging, emergency shutdown, and 3-phase metering.  Electrical modules will be provided for 35kV switchgear, 35kV transformers, variable frequency drives (VFDs) for the ESPs, and for electrical and instrumentation equipment.  A VFD transformer module also may be included pending a decision on the type of VFD to be installed.  Also included are an unheated storage building and blast-resistant control module housing utility equipment and control room.  The control module will include a communications mast.

Phase 1 of this project will install only 31 of the 51 total wells.  The gravel pad and well row piping and instrumentation will be installed to accommodate all 51 wells, but only one VFD module housing 15 VFDs will be provided. The plot plan will accommodate the addition of a future VFD module for the remaining production wells.  This phase includes supply and installation of 31 wellhouses.
