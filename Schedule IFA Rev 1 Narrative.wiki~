= Overview/Summary =

Upon receipt of Notice to Proceed (NTP) from the client, Anvil issued a schedule for Review (the IFR Schedule) on 5/25/2014. The client reviewed this schedule and in a teleconference on 6/30/2014 provided comments to Anvil on the schedule. The IFR Schedule is the basis for Anvil's resource forecast.

In the following weeks, Anvil incorporated the client's comments, along with progress and input from Anvil disciplines, as well as information obtained through efforts to complete the FEED package (reference CN03) to further develop the schedule. On 8/25/2014, Anvil issued a schedule for approval (the IFA Schedule) to the client. It is this schedule that Anvil has used as the basis for schedule date change. For example, CN 17 shifts the Well Row Pipe Rack IFF date 3 weeks relative to the IFA Schedule.

In October 2014, in consultation with Ben Anglen, client project leader, Anvil was instructed to revise the schedule logic to reflect incorporation of all VDDR into the work packages prior to Issuing them for Review (IFR.) This effort resulted in a Rev 1 to the IFA Schedule addressed in CN 21. Pending client approval, this schedule is expected to be the baseline for the remainder of the project with any further changes addressed through change management.
