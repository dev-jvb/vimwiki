The following scheudle changes were made during January 2015.

On December 31, 2014, It was agreed that WP0006 and WP0012 would Issue for Fabrication on 2/11/2015. This is a 1 week slide from the IFA Baseline IFF date of 2/4/2015. This slide is to accommodate incorporation of VDDR information for the Air Handling Units. On February 2, an additional slide from 2/4/2015 to 2/25/2015 to reduce/eliminate engineering holds in the work packages was agreed to.

On January 5, 2015, it was agreed that WP0013 would Issue for Fabrication on 2/4/2015. This is a 4 week slide from the IFA Baseline IFF date of 1/7/2015. This chang eis to allow time for incorporation of information from GIS to reduce the engineering holds in the work package.

On January 28, 2015, Anvil received direction from Caelus to not issue WP0013 until all input from GIS is received. It was agreed that Anvil would require 2 weeks after receipt of the HVAC I/O and electrical loads to IFF the work package. The IFF date was changed from 2/4/2015 to 2/18/2015 (unde rthat assumption that Anvil would receive the required data by 2/4/2015. (The material has not yet been received and the IFF date is at risk for further delay.)

On February 4, it was agreed to change the IFF date for WP0008 and WP0010 from 2/2/5/2015 to 3/4/2015. This change is to avoid the need to release 4 IFF Packages in the same week.
