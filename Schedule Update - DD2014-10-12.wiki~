Pigging Module - CSYS.129 - Vendor Drawing Review - What drawings need to be reviewed and are they needed for IFF? @ Ken Garcia

Per Ken Garcia: There are no VDDR needs to make IFF.

Blowdown Tank - How to re-structure schedule. Do we no longer need to wait for tank VDDR? @Anna

Per discussion with Mirek: We could IFF on original date with a hold for anchor bolt diameter. Anvil to determine anchor locations, tank vendor to define anchor diameter. Or, we could hold off until vendor provides anchor diameter and IFF without holds. Fabrication of this module is not holding up any others. Anna will put the question to Ben tomorrow.

= Schedule Update Summary =

Reciept of VDDR data continues to be a concern. Until POs are placed, we have only estimates of when VDDR will be received. Anvil is working with disciplines to identify the most critical date and with vendors as orders are placed to obtain the most critical data as early as possible.

Following a discussion at Anvil with the client, Anvil was able to mitigate the slide in the IFF date for WP0009 - Blowdown Tank. Anvil will provide the tank vendor with the anchor locations and IFF the package with holds for the anchor bolt diameter. This allows Anvil to meet the planned IFF date of 11/12/2014.

The WP0011 - 35kV Transformer Platform and WP0012 - 35 kV Switchgear Module IFR and IFF dates continue to slide as a result of estimates for receipt of vendor data for the Transformers and AHU respectively. PO placement for the transformers is imminent and Anvil expects to receive sufficient VDDR on the Transformers to enable some schedule recovery. The AHU for WP0012 must be re-bid as the previous vendor was determined to be unqualified. Schedule impact of this delay is still evolving.

Anvil continues to explore alternative package issue sequences in an effort to mitigate delays and support leveling of module fabrication workload.
