NOTE: It is necessary to pull data from Progress Tracker differently for Physical Percent complete and Remaining Units update. This is because the Physical Percent Complete is totalled differently when the PT data is grouped by Work Group (which is necessary for Remaining Units update.)

Update Physical Percent Complete

1. Export from P6:
      - Select Spreadhseet - (XLS) for the Export Format.
      - On Export Type screen, select Activities and Resource Assignments (top and bottom choices)
      - Select the project to export
      - Select the Progress Tracking Update Template
      - Choose the location and name of the export file
      - When the export is finished, open the export file in Excel and create a new tab (Sheet 1)

2. In Progress Tracker:
     - Select the Summary Information tab
     - Select the Program, Client, Job and Phase
     - Group by Sub Job, WBS and Schedule Activity ID.
     - Hit Find Now.
     - When the data is returned, click Edit, Select All (or Ctrl A)
     - Click Edit, Copy (or Ctrl C). Click Yes to also copy the Column headings.
     - Switch to the export file in Excel and paste the data into cell B1 of Sheet 1.

3. Build percent complete lookup formulas in export file: 
     - Enter the following formula in cell A2 of Sheet 1 to construct the SAID
	     ="ANV."&LEFT(B2,3)&"."&IF(LEFT(C2,3)="010","010",MID(C2,2,3))&"."&D2
     - Fill down the formula to cover all rows of the data.
     - Switch to the TASK tab of the export file.
     - Enter the following formula in cell J3 of the TASK tab  (This formula looks up the Percent complete for each Activity from the Progress Tracker data on Sheet 1.):
	     =VLOOKUP(A3,Sheet1!$A:$I,8,FALSE)*100
     - Fill down the formula to cover all rows of the data.
     - Copy the data in column J and Paste Values into Column E (user_number1).

4. Create a new tab (Sheet 2) in the export file.

5. In Progress Tracker:
     - Select the Summary Information tab
     - Select the Program, Client, Job and Phase
     - Group by Sub Job, Work Group, WBS and Schedule Activity ID.
     - Hit Find Now.
     - When the data is returned, click Edit, Select All (or Ctrl A)
     - Click Edit, Copy (or Ctrl C). Click Yes to also copy the Column headings.
     - Paste the data into cell B1 of Sheet 2 in the export file.
     - Enter the following formula in cell A2 of Sheet 2 to construct the SAID
	     ="ANV."&LEFT(B2,3)&"."&IF(LEFT(D2,3)="010","010",MID(D2,2,3))&"."&E2

6. Build remaining units lookup formula in export file:
     - Switch to the TASKRSRC tab of the export file.
     - Enter the following formula in cell J3 of the TASKRSRC tab  (This formula looks up the EHTC for each resource on each Activity from the Progress Tracker data on Sheet 2.):
	     =INDEX(Sheet2!$A$2:$I$5000,MATCH(1,(Sheet2!A$2:A$5000=TASKRSRC!A3)*(Sheet2!C$2:C$5000=TASKRSRC!F3),0),7)
	     NOTE: This is an array formula. You must press Ctrl-Shift-Enter after typing in the formula for it to work correctly.
     - Fill down the formula to cover all rows of the data.
     - Copy the data in column J and Paste Values into Column G (Remaining Early Units(h))
     - Save and close the export file.

7. Import the file back into P6:
     - In P6, with the Project open, click File, Import.
     - Select Spreadsheet -(XLS) for the Import Format.
     - Navigate to and select the modified export file.
     - On Import Type screen, select Activities and Resource Assignments (top and bottom choices; should be the only ones not grayed out.)
     - On Import Project Options Screen select the project in the Import To box.
     - Click on OK when the import is complete. (Do not worry about 'Errors were recorded; we'll validate the data later.)

8. Visually scan the data:
     - In the Activities view in P6, add the user_number1 column to your layout. Position it next to the Physical % Complete column. This will allow a visual comparison between the current Physical % Complete and the Progress TRacker % Complete (in the user_number1 column.)
     - Scan the two columns for any obvious errors. In general, the value in the user_number1 column should be greater than or equal to the Physical & Complete column.
     - Once you are satisifed tha the values in the user_number1 column reflect the desired Physical % Complete, proceed to Perform the Global Update.

9. Perform Global Update:
     - In P6, Click Tools, Global Change.
     - Select the Physical % Complete1 and click Apply Change.
     - Review the error report. Note that you will see an error for each completed activity because you cannot modify the % complete of a completed activity.
     - After reviewing the report, click on Commit Changes in lower right of the report window. This will actually perform the change in the schedule.
     - Save the log file if desired.
     - Close the Global Change window.

10. Import validation:
     - Scan the Physical % Complete and user_number1 columns now, they should be the same.
     - Note 2: Changing an activity's Physical % Complete to 100% does not automatically change the activity status to Completed. You should review all activities where Physical % Complete = 100 and Activity Status does not equal Complete and manually complete them (or not) as needed to satisfy schedule logic.
     - Note 3: An activity that is Not Started cannot have it's Physical Percent complete changed from 0. You should filter for these cases and manually start the activity and enter the Physical % Complete.

11. Verify Remaining Units against EHTC:
     - Add the Remaining Labor Units column to your layout.
     - Compare the Remaining Labor Units to the EHTC from reporting/Progress Tracking for the Project and each WBS. Adjust resource assignments as needed to get amounts to align (within reason.)
