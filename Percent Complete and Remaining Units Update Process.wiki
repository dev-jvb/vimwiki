In P6:
     - Export XLS
          - Select Activities and Resource Assignments
     - Use the Progress Tracking Update Template

In PT:
     - Use Summary tab
     - Group by Sub Job, WBS and SAID
     - Copy Paste results into Progress Tracking Update workbook (Paste data into Column B.)

In Excel:
     - Build a formula in Column A to construct the SAID (="ANV."&LEFT(B14,3)&"."&MID(C14,2,3)&"."&D14)
     - Use LOOKUP function to fill in user_number column:
	     - (=IF(VLOOKUP(A3,Sheet1!$A$2:$M$543,8,FALSE)*100>VALUE(E3),VLOOKUP(A3,Sheet1!$A$2:$M$543,8,FALSE)*100,E3)
             - JMD - 10/13/2014 - Per discussion with Justin, modified the lookup formula to use an IF statement to preclude lowering of % Complete from the scheduled value.
     - Use formula to update remaining units (note that this is an ARRAY formual; Ctrl-Shift-Enter):
	     - =INDEX(Sheet1!$A$2:$G$900,MATCH(1,(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$900=TASKRSRC!A3)*(Sheet1!$C$2:$C$900=TASKRSRC!F3),0),7)	

In P6:
     - Import XLS
     - Use Global Change
	     - Update %Complete with User_Number1
