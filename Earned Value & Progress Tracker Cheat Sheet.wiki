Earned Value & Progress Tracker Cheat Sheet

In Progress Tracker:
     Budget at Completion (BAC) = Current Budget for the element
     Earned = BAC * % Complete
     Estimated Hours to Complete (EHTC) = The hours remaining to complete the element
     Forecast (FCST) = The expected hours that will be used to complete the element; assuming work continues at the same pace.
          FCST = EHTC / (1 - %Comp)

In Reporting:
     Earned = BAC * % Complete
     Current Budget = Original Budget + Approved Changes
     Pending Budget = Current Budget + Pending Changes
                    = Original Budget + Approved Changes + Pending Changes
     Trended Forecast = Pending Budget + Trends
                      = Current Budget + Pending Changes + Trends
                      = Original Budget + Approved Changes + Pending Changes + Trends
     Estimate at Completion (EAC) = Actual + EHTC
