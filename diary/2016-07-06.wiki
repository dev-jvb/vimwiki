Howard noted a discrepancy in the Owner Material for Structural in APEX for 107162. Upon investigation, found several lines of Owner Material were missing. Entered them manually and all is matchy-matchy. Funny thing is, I verified this estimate vs APEX on 5/31 and it was dead on. Something changed between 5/31 and 7/6.
Out at 1630.
