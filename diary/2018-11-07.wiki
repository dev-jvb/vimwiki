Arrive 0815.
Prepared Cost Summary Reports for October reporting packages.
Reviewed funding and invoicing for 108229. Found small descrepancy where some Assess work was billed to the Select PO. Dena looking to get approval to bump the PO value to compensate. On further research, this may NOT have been Assess work after all. Ugh.
Out at 1630.
