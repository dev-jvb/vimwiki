Arrive 0800.
Continued work on Q4 report. Provided drafts to Geoff for review.
Met with Justin and Jeff Jacobi to discuss Bryan Galbraith. Thinking is that he will live in Bldg L and do mostly BP work. We will not use him for Shell scheduling but may engage with him on some entry-level costing work. Important to not be perceived as training him at Shell's expense when he is destined for BP.
Out at 1630.
