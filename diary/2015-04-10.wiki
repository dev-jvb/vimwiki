Prepared 107315 cost report.

Discussed with Heather switching BRPC reporting to Tuesdays instead of Fridays. Data would be more fresh. Heather to discuss with Ron and Cynthia. Would start next Tuesday if agreed. Raised slight concern about time to massage data if necessary.

Talked to Chuck Russo re % Complete on Control Systems Designer. He feels good about his progress. Not being held up (yet) by anything, so making good progress. Needs information from Structural and Piping, so they may become a bottleneck for him at some point.

Received narrative from Heather and issued cost report.

Out at 1130.
