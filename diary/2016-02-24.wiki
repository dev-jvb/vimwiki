Discussed program forecast with Angie. Not feeling good about our forecasting accuracy. Definitely room for improvement. Data provided by Justin showing forecast accuracy for 2015 shows ShellPSR program is better than most in forecast accuracy. 
Discussed TSO reporting needs with Tim. Debra Newbry is asking for changes to reporting schedules and there are indications of a desire for more detailed reporting for TSO. Asked Tim to keep me informed of new requests so that we can capture them.
