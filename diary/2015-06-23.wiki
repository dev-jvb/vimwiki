Voicemail from Terry re: "anomalies" in recent BRPC report. Zero period earned for Buyer/Expeditor (again.) Emailed Gerry THompson asking if there was anything I could do to help get tracking done reliably each week.

Called Comcast/Xfinity. CSR Misty. Agreed to 2 year, fixed price contract. Includes more channels (added Showtime and others), higher internet speed and X1 platform hardware. All for $206/month. We have 30 days after the new hardware arrives to try it out and cancel w/o penalty.

Cynthia called me a bit ago with some request for clarifications on our reports. She had a couple of suggestions for the bi-weekly narrative:

	- More clearly delineate the job numbers we are reporting on in the narrative. On the first page there is a blue header listing 107315 and 107386 (no mention of 107384.)
	- Include % complete in the narrative for each job number. (I showed her where she could find the % complete information in the cost report; however, she would still like to see the % complete in the narrative.

We also discussed the various funding documents that have been in play. I think we are all square on those.

Attended Project controls Safety Meeting - Key message - be creative in finding ways to meet client needs. BP Program Summary Report as example.
