Traded emails with Justin. Plan is to dedicate 25-30 hours/week to Caelus program starting Monday. Justin will give me cost and schedule responsibility on one of the major projects and work me into the lead role over the coming months. Jim Eaton is OK with this plan. I will maintain cost and schedule reponsibility for NHDS through Execute (current last IFC date is 6/19.)

Setup vimwiki for [[../Caelus|Caelus]] program. Reviewe dproject documents for 106726.

Upon further review, Pederson is owed a 25% progress payment for shop drawings on the priority steel. Priority steel is 88k, so progress payment (accrual) is 88*.25=22k. Advised John Andres by phone.
