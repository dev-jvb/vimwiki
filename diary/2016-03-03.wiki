Arrive 0800. 
Email from Jim Holien detailing further issues on the 105483 estimate that need to be resolved before issuing. Spent several hours re-jigging and cross-checking the estimate. An issue was found with BoD coding in EBSs 5 and 6. Once that was squared away, totals matched up. 
Out at 1630.
