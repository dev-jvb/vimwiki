Kickoff meeting for BRPC Mustang set for 1000 BLI.
	The module width for Caelus is 18 ft. BRPC would like 20 ft. Raised concerns about scope creep.
	DECISION: Go forward with 20 ft module width.
	IFR Package for 3 April will be Be Caelus package (which is already complete.) It will not match the exact scope, but is close enough for fabricators to prepare bids (per Ron Otero.)
	New milestones:
		30 Mar 2015 Flooring Plan Complete
		03 Apr 2015 Issue MTO for Piles to BRPC
	New Sub Job and CN needed for Module 63A - Fuel Gas Treatment Module.
		Still need better scope definition on this.
	BRPC signalling desire for reporting similar to BRPC Procurement Project (ref. Justin.)
	Asked leads to review PSE and realign the hours with the DAPP. Also, once the hours roll into tracker, get EHTC Forecasting tuned up.

Applied for Project Control Specialist position at Tesoro Anacortes.
