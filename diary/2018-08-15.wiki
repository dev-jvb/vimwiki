Responded to Dena's question about "84 hours" of Technical Writing on 04843 (I don't see it.) Realized that no direction has been given wrt Technical Writing budgets now that the TW group has been dissolved. Later found that Dena was actually referring to 108229.
Setup 105787.499 for "Warranty" work on Pipe Spec Correction per Harv direction.
Transferred 8.5 hours from WE 8/10 from Structural Designer to Civil Designer at Chris Seigman request. See email thread. I'm concerned that this is an effort to true up the Strucutral Design CPI for WE 8/10 as the transfer would move the CPI from 0.85 to 1.0.
Reviewed APP and signed checklist for 108381.
Out at 1630.
