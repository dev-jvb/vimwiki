* Responded to question from Terry regarding dates when Haldor-Topsoe will be needed on-site. Assumed that their work is part of Dressing the reactor activity. We may need to break this work down more to show the H-T on-site period.
* Emailed copies of approved CNs 112 and 115 to John Andres.

Met with Kevin re PC Lead role in Caelus program. Program consists of 3 projects. Projections are for up to 100 FTEs. So this would indicate making this a program of its own. Program Leader would be Brent Belsher. PC Lead would need to partner (Kevin's word) with Brent for program success. Also, Caelus is a financial company and it is vital to keep a tight reign on change management and assure that only funded work is performed.

Kevin is still thinking through program organization. Conoco-Phillips work could have some influence as it would likely consume Justin. Caelus project controls team would likely consist of a lead, 1-2 schedulers (1 each in Bham and Anch.) and 1-2 cost engineers (likely in Bham.)

Kevin does agree that I am a good candidate for the PC Lead role. Just need a few other pieces to fall into place. Kevin will let me know.
