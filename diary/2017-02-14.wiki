Arrive 0800.
Researched Erik Schoen charges from January and where they need to land. Discussed with Geoff who suggested push back as it is too late to make these revisions after invoicing. Shell PLs need to manage their spend, not Anvil's on-site personnel.
Had to re-enter invoice 199702 because it did not go through.
Diane reported that invoice 199720 also did not go through.
Talked with Mandy re issues around credit memos. There is a need for a report that lists the invoices and the PO s to which they were ACTUALLY submittedeach month. This to eliminate disconnect between A/R and SPSR. Per Diane, Jenny Low may already receive a report that would close the loop.
Out at 1630.
