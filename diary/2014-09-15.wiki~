Sat with Marcus Casserd and reviewed schedule update workbook. He deferred to Brian Baker on most. Called Brian and discussed letting 3D model slide to 9/25; and still support new IFR of 10/1. #106726

Updated schedule with EQUI input from schedule update workbook. Looks like a tangle in the procurement for WP0008 and WP0009. Also need to look at EQUI Procurement in WP0013. #106726
