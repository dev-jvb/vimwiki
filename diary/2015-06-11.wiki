Arrive 0800.

Chris noted that two CN 21 elements for Structural did not come over to PT. Justin and I researched and found that the additional hours had been applied to existing elements. Adjusted % complete for these elements to bring EHTC to the amount in CN21.

Updated timesheet for the week.

Out at 1630.
