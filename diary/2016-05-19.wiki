Arrive 0800. 
Voicemail from Brent. Met with Brent to discuss PMB for 107550. Agreed that we should fall back to the APP as submitted to be our PMB. Also discussed that we may not be tracking well to that plan. In addition, we discussed that when the extent of revisions are known, we will have a new plan that picks up wherever we are at the time and proceeds to the end of the phase. Brent needs the min-month report by noon today to take with him to the monthly project meeting at Shell this afternoon. Also, he wants to email the revised IPA workbooks to IPA by the end of the week. Communicated this to Angie via email.
