Reviewed weekly cost report. Noted that Process Engineer is 208% of budget in 441/010. Investigation reveals that PT has this at 100% complete. Turned off the 441/010 charge element for Process Engineer to prevent further charges.

Earl Mabe has 41 hours on 441/0002 for Fire Marshall Plot Plan. Where is the budget for this? It's not in 441/0002. The hours may need to be moved to somewhere with a budget. Called Earl and the charges should be going to the 0001 (P&IDs) WBS. Transferred the hours for WEs 5/23-6/13 using the HTU. Deactivated the 0002 WBS in Charge Element Editor.

Sent email to Diana asking her to review the elements for Piping Designer and identify those that should be HVAC Designer. Upon receipt of that data, will need to resolve with Piping to make sure that they are OK with the transfers.
