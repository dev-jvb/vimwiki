Arrive 0700.
Attend weekly Pl/WGL meeting.
Published CN3 to Progress Tracker for 105478.
Discussed invoiceing for 106152 with Diane Berhow and Matt Gross. Acrual report forecasting SJ300 charges in excess of remaining PO amount. However, since SJ300 was closed a coupel of weeks ago, it is unlikely that the charges will exceed what is already there (which is within the remaining PO value.) Provided an updated accrual file to Diane reflecting this.
Closed 107726 as PO was closed back in June.
Submitted vision claim to VSP.
Assigned CN03 baseline as project baseline on 105478.
Out at 1630.
