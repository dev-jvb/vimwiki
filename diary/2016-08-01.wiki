Arrive 0800.
Met with Kevin, Tim and Jeff Jacobi to discuss Tim's transition. Cascadia/Jeff will take on the weekly Tesoro reporting. Jim Holien's HDO Mitigation Project (106960) will go to Angie to replace PRINT. According to Tim, the HDO reporting is very similar to that for PRINT and is budgetd for ~20 hours per week (need to verify this.)
Paid Comcast bill.
Jeff Jacobi reached out to indicate the Deanna Starcher has some time freeing up and can take on the HDO reporting. This will keep the HDO project cleanly int he Cascadia program, which is a good thing.
Out at 1630.
