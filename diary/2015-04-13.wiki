Chris exported CN2 to 107386.

Deleted CN4 at Heather's direction. Did not contain any hours. NOTE: Have to delete associated elements in the Find Tool before deleting the CN in Change Management.

Attended BRPC weekly team meeting. Stressed that earned performance is lagging. CPIs are poor as are SPIs. (Later discussion with Heather, she is concerned that some may be sandbagging.)

Talked to Bill Scott about STRU-E tracking. He volunteered for a PT training session, Wednesday morning at his desk.

Discussed with Werner need to issue BRPC reports on Tuesday. Werner also relayed a request from CSG to not display rate information on the report. Discussed with Justin and we are in agreement.

Set up client funding for P2-200 on JN 107384 and JN 107391. Deducted from funding on 107315 SJ220.
