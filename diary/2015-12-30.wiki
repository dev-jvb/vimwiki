poke with Geoff Latimer re PO for 107483. We are still holding November hours and will soon be holding December hours. Geoff will contact John Clair to see where we stand with getting a PO. 
Talked to Howard about APEX and the PSR for 107433; items not appearing. After talking to Alison, only those items that have an Anvil MR number and are Owner Equipment will appear on the PSR. As the Electrical Building is a major piece of subcontractor-supplied equipment, I changed the TIC Budget Category to Owner Equipment to get it on the PSR for visibility.
