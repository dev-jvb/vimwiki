Arrive 0730. 
Transferred hours form 107430 and 431 P3 to P4 per Harv's request. 
Prepared 030 report on 107483 for Dean Zehner. Discussed in follow up call. 
Learned that Chase was unable to process payment because it is not possible to do ETF directly from HELOC. Had to go to People's Bank and establish a checking account for ETFs to flow through. Advised Chase of new routing and account numbers and had late fee waived. 
Contacted AmEx re the same issue. Advised that I should re-submit online payment using correct numbers. Bad numers will just fail harmlessly. 
Attended 107483 team meeting. Scope stilll unresolved around overfill protection. Until this is resolved, project is largely stalled. Talked to Dean Zehner about F&G scope; do we need to CN it out? Not sure yet. Also, John Clair has a schedule from Greg Forney showing integration with Construction schdule. Dean and John may want to review next week at Shell. Offerred to Dean that Paul may be able to support if he is also on site that day. 
Reviewed client funding on 107225 at request from Geoff Latimer. Management report showing we are short funding. Actuals in management report are through 2/5 and we are OK through 1/29 based on invoice values. 106888 does look to be short but remaining PO balance is sufficient to cover January invoice. Need to audit 106888 client funding amounts. 
Out at 1700.
