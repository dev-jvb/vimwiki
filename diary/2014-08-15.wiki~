Worked on reconciliation of IPDMS with schedule. Lots of MRs are not listed in the schedule; need to determine if they are needed. Many can likely be consolidated; Well Row Pipe Rack steel probably only needs one nod eint ehs chedul as it all needs to be on-site at the fabricator at the same time. Spoke with Mirek about this plan and he agreed. #106726

Confirmed with Nadine Janacek that MRs 4079 and 4083 are no longer being purchased by Anvil and so can be removed from the schedule. #106726
