Arrive 0800.

Office stuff not moved. Finally got everything moved into Bldg E ~1130.

105726 - Meeting with Brent, Justin, Ron (on phone), and Pam to discuss reporting.

Reviewed cost report from Erik. Gave feedback on a couple of typos and asked for columns to be rearranged for consistency; hrs - dollars or dollars - hours. Not particular which; but would like consistency. Also, consider adding a progress bar to visually show percent of budget spent.

Turned off SJ300 for all disciplines. These hours and associated budgets will need to be transferred into P4.

Asked Erik to research and update client funding on NDS-1.

Investigation of cost overrun on Process Engineering in SJ441, WBS010; Budget was for 35 hours at 93.57/hour. Actual hours were 47 at a cost of 5293 for an actual rate of 112.62. Interestingly, the cost report lists this as 6,617. This is probably related to the issue that Justin was describing earlier regarding how reporting handles rates. It appears that Process Engineering is complete for this WBS and that no further charges are expected.

105675 - Reviewed CN for P3 and verified that it was in PT. No earned hours yet.

Out at 1800.
