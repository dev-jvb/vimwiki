Met with CSYS (Ken Swalley, Ken Garcia, Joe Schramer, Richard Martinez) and Electrical (Erik Jonson, Cesar Salire, Mark Ridenhour) to discuss staffing. CSYS staffing is OK; Ken Garcia expressed concern about getting HVAC deliverables. Erik Jonson is confident that current Electrical staffing is adequate to meet schedule issue dates. Did question whether or not post-IFF hours (for FAT, drawing reviews, etc.) are properly represented in the schedule.

Updated %Complete and Remaining Units in schedule in anticipation of schedule update.

Updated IFF schedule with deadline dates for getting docs to PA.

Cleaned up some schedule issues associate with the mysterious disappearance of the module fab WBS.

Attended conference call with Quyen Kay.

Followed up with Chris Higgins wrt Quyen's concern about outstanding POs for OTPEX that may be impacting issue dates. Chirs has this on his radar and provided his graphic schedule for my reference.

Out at 1730.
