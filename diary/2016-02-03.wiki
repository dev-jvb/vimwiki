Arrive 0645. 
Attended weekly WGL meeting. 
Transferred my and Tim's time off of 106504.500 to 107225.499. 
Received Invoicing History for 107225 from Mary Shoemaker. Able to discern that $120,247.14 of P4 work was (most probably) invoiced against the P3 PO. This is offset by $63,303 of P3 work billed to the P4 PO. Need to add this to the P4 PO value to align correct P4 funding. 
Processed new PO for 107746. 
Set up recurring Monday 10 @ 10 for Shell Project Controls team. 
Tim ran Onsite Cap Project hours report and emailed to Heather Calvin. 
Changed CN4 on 107049 to have Anvil Budget Status = COA and Client Budget Status = Trend. This allowed assocaited budget to be available fof earning in Progress Tracker. This per discussion with Ron Peterson. 
On 107283, do we need to re-distribute Scott Hackett's January hours among the 300, 301, 302 sub-jobs fof billing? Geoff is wondering. 
Out at 1630.
