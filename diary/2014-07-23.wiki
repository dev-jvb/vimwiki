Mike Dyer inquired about notes associated with the Procurement PSE element for 106726. Mike had notes attached to the element in the Original Budget (CN0). Now, he sees only the notes attached to the most recent CN (CN3). Where are the OB Notes? Left a VM for Aaron Rockwell and called Kevin Formway. Kevin was on his way to a meeting, but will call when he is done. #106726

Spoke to Aaron Rockwell; concluded tha tthere must not have been any notes aattached to the OB element. Mike Dyer allows tha this could be the case. Per Rockwell, the notes, if they existed, would still be there as there is no mechanism by which they can be overwritten. #106726
