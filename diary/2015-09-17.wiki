Opened CN3 for 107226.

Talked to Harv about 106818 invoice. He thinks this should probably be part of 106504 but would like to hold the invoice until next month as he expects a small amount of additional charges to come. Contacted Mary Shoemaker to see if it is not too late to hold. Per Mary, it is too late to hold it. Will set invoice aside and enter next month.

Left office at 1400 to go to SPSR.

Departed SPSR at 1645.
