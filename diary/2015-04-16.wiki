Arrive 0800.

Per direction from Brent, this weeks schedule update, DD 2015-04-12, will be the last. There will be no more Scheduling effort on NDS-1.

Completed (last?) NDS-1 Primavera schedule update.

Reviewed and signed 107384 (Module 64) DAPP and checklist.

Talked to Brent about Caelus hours going forward. Continue to support 4-5 hours week, billed as CostE, for meetings, Tom oversight, minor schedule support with IFF table and VDDR reports.

Called PeaceHealth; claim submitted to EBMS in error; will re-submit to WebTPA.

Talked to Justin about workload. Thinking we should shoot for 3/4 time for CostE and 1/2 time for Scheduler on Brooks work.

With Cliff's direction, adjusted PSE budget to align with DAPP. Published PSE to Progress Tracker and announced to team.

Spread EHTC hours for CostE and Scheduler.

Justin allowed that should things get tight, I might get sucked into Cascadia a little. May also pick up a few hours for 107278 reporting.
