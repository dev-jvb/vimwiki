Replied to Tom Pauly email re: invoiing on 107926.300 and 102698.312. Need to prepare and issue a rate trend CN for 107926 to get PO increased to cover March (final) define invoice.
Dicussed P&ID Validation milestone with Geoff. He agrees that our policy of allowing movement of  the date renders the KPI less than helpful. Suggested that I follow up with Justin for history.
Geoff reminded me that we need to pro-rate KPI scores on the Fee KPI scoresheet. Will likely have a strong negative impact on our score for Q1.
Prepared Rev 1 of Q1 Report.
Prepared monthly KPI report and sent to Geoff for review/comment.
Setup PSE for 107899. Subjob for each unit and WBS for each scope item.
Issued weekly reports to SPSR.
