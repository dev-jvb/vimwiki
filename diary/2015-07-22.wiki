Arrive 0745.

Call from Cynthia. Inquiried about actuals on 107407 for WE 7/10. There were none as the job was shut down that week. Reviewed current IFF dates with her. Discussed need for additional funding. She is aware and is buried. Subsequent to call, I emailed her to advise tha the value of CN27 (Schedule slide due to PO delays) had increased to $13000 from $6500 due to no PO by 7/17. Cynthia acknowledged receipt of the revision email.

Requested Chris to update CN27 PSE to reflect amount for current PO slide.

Talked to Jeff Carleton about his email discussing use of 107407 budget. He has prioritzed elements of the interconnect package that make sense to work on now given our partial funding status. He will charge and progress this work in 107407. He is not using 107407 budget to complete 107386 work.
