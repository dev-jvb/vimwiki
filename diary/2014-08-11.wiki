VM from Terry. See email from John Andres. Need to resolve EAC question.

Pending budget increases with Change. Change also adds to the EHTC and thereby to the EAC (EAC = Actual + EHTC).

At Terry's direction, statused the following disciplines to 100% complete in P4:
        Control Systems Engineer
        Electrical Engineer
        Equipment Engineer to 98%
        HVAC/FP Engineer
        Project Assistant
        Project Leader
        Structural Designer

Net result was a reduction in the P4 EHTC of 413 hours.

Copied Control Systesm WBS from VFD 1 module into new VFD 2 Module. Also verified that SAIDs are assigned in PSE for the CN5 elements. Added CN05 to UDF2 to aid in locating elements in Tracker.

Out at 1715.
