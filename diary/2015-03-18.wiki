Started schedule updating. Ran IPDMS Exception Report and tuned up schedule. Performed % Complete and Remaining Units update.

Revised project restart schedules per discussion with Brent and Anna.

Updated graphic schedule with Anna.

Conference call with Mike Moora and Heather Marshburn re BRPC Module 63 DAPP. Expresed concern about PMAC being light on hours. Provided assumptions in PSE tool outlining minimal PMAC support commensurate with number of hours budgeted. Mike's general position was that the budget is what it is and he is not amenable to upward revisions. Indicated the BRPC had signed off on the budget (no idea at what rate it was bid.) Nervous.

Prepared 002 Reports for NDS-1 CNs 26, 32 and 33 for Brent.

Prepared schedule materials for bi-weekly report.

Out at 1630.
