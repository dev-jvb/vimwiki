In at 0745. (Had to stop at Napa for 4Runner valve cover bolts and grommets.)

Attended meeting with Quyen, Ben, Anna and Brent to discuss schedule. Caelus has waived IFR on many packages and agreed to abbreviated IFRs on others. Interactively worked the schedul eto arrive at somethign that can (hopefully) be agreed upon.
