106726 - After discussion with Cesar, revised logic around VFD selection milestone to reflect selection after receipt of bids from vendor. Per PSR, MR received in Procurement 7/9 and RFQ out on 7/10. Need to confirm with Mike Dyer if RFQ was sent to vendors for bids or just to Quyen for review (Justin believes it was sent to vendors.) Logic change created a -20d variance to BL for VFD selection; however, the PO Issue date is 1d ahead of BL at 7/31.

Produced a "Level 2" schedule for Brent for NDS-1, OTPEX, and PGP. Used PNR WBS MS Review layout. Note the user_text1 controls visibility.

Attended Building E BBQ/Potluck.

Out at 1645.
