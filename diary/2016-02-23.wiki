Re-imported TIC Estimate into APEX for 107431. Needed to pick up Control Panels that were entered in TICe as Contractor-supplied and not Owner-Purchased equipment. Would be nice if there were an easier way to pick up a single item that did not require re-importing the entire estimate, then deleting all but the one item desired.
