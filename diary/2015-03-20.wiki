Arrive 0815.

Received RFS from BRPC for Mustang Module 63. Noted that the DAPP hours were sourced from SJ415 which does not include Manage & Coordinate hours that were swept into SJ400. Per Heather, Mike and Ron approved the DAPP hours and they include any M&C required.

Met with Justin. Furture looks cloudy.Playing chicken with Caelus on funding. Polish resume; look for more work from BRPC. Possibilities in Billings. Maybe some Shell work in the summer. Justin is pushing to keep Tom and I. Start looking for other work. Will go to 32s if necessary.

Out at 1315.
