Arrive 0730.
Talked to Jim about Procurement On-Site KPI. We _should_ be comparing the MR Required On-Site date with the Actual On-Site date; _not_ the Forecast vs Actual. Re-pulled data and it makes more sense now. There is an open question about prior quarters performance though as the var was measured differently.
Setup 102698.314 to capture 106215 closeout costs to new PO 4520403531.
Continued work on Q3 report. Still waiting for surveys to come back. Geoff's poll of client PLs indicates that they were sent back; so they appear to be stuck on our end somewhere. Angie is in contact with Erik Eklund to see what's up.
Discussion with Dena regarding "overrun" on 107756. Part of the issue is $18.5k of Select phase charges going against the Execute PO. This, combined with an $11k forecast overrun led her to see a $29k potential overrun. Situation will need to continue to be monitored.
Out at 1630.
