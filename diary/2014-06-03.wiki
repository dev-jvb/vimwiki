Mirek Wazny noted descrepancies between the elements available in Timesheets and the WBS numbering/description schema. Also noted that SJ443 was not available in Timesheets. Checking ACE, found SJ443 was marked as On-Hold Booked. Switched to Active to get it to appear in Timesheet (hopefully.) In addition, ther eappears to be SJ400 floating around in the Charge Elements.
