Attended BRPC Team Meeting.
	HVAC has some concerns about making Module 62 IFR on Friday. Concern stems from handoff of HVAC Design responsibilities from Matt Schiavi to Dave Cunningham in BLI. Asked Heather if we couldn't make this handoff next week to allow us to stay on target for IFR. Would avoid shooting ourselves in the foot on the schedule. Heather will look into it but is not sure that it is in her purview.
