Arrive 0700.

Produced shaded NDS1 calendar.

Discussed P5 budget with Justin and Brent. Settled on 2-3% of P4 budget; so ~2000 hours for NDS-1. Also agreed that there is no benefit to breaking P5 down into WPs. There may however be some benefit to having 2-3 sub jobs; module fab support and construction support.

Worked with Tom on justification for CN16 Schedule slide in WP0011. Slide driven by Transformer VDDR. Delay in placing PO for transformers driven by additional grounding requirements and, after receiving bids, Caelus insisting that Siemens be allowed to bid (an extra week.) Per Kent, Electrical excluded them [Siemens] for whatever reason and this didn’t sit well with Caelus, so now they have been included. This added a week to the bidding process. PO Expected to be placed next week.

Attended NDS-1 Team Meeting.
WP0011 - 35kV Transformer Platform - IFR not driven by Transformer VDDR; re-link to IFF. Will allow IFR to meet IFA schedule. Anna to confirm with Brent.

Out at 1700.
