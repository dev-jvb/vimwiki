Arrive 0745.

Prepared and emailed Change Log for 107315 to Cynthia.

On request from Cynthia, prepared composite rates through 4/24 and emailed. Used data from the BIT to determine rates. Caveat, April invoices not yet final, so rates could shift slightly. Also note that in BIT, Engineering job hours include P2 work, so they don't align perfectly with cost reports that reflect only P4 work.

Attended Caelus coordination Call. CSYS is holding up work on both OTPEX and NDS-1. Ron Otero to be OoO beginning tomorrow. CC Mike Moora on reports in Ron's absence.

Call with Ron and Werner. Concern about amount remaining on seed funding. Went through calcs and looked at amounts in BIT. Looks like we are OK, but barely. Advised Heather that we need to watch charges closely on 107407-SJ200. Need to reconcile when April invoice is complete. There are some employee classification discrepancies in BIT that need to be resolved. Werner to work with Mandy in Business Services to get sorted.

Out at 1630.
