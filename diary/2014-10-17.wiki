Arrive 0715.

Looked at NDS-1 SPI for last three periods. It is improving:

|               | WE 9/26 | WE 10/03 | WE 10/10 |
|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Earned Hours  | 25797   | 27635    | 29495    |
| Planned Hours | 27376   | 28753    | 30216    |
| SPI           | 0.94    | 0.96     | 0.98     |

Sent results to Brent for his reference.

For OTPEX:

|               | WE 9/26 | WE 10/03 | WE 10/10 |
|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Earned Hours  | 23707   | 25142    | 26811    |
| Planned Hours | 29853   | 31823    | 33414    |
| SPI           | 0.79    | 0.79     | 0.80     |


Variance due to Rate Differential

     Variance   = Earned Dollars - Actual Dollars
                = (Earned Hours x Budget Rate) - (Actual Hours x Actual Rate)

If we are working at 100% efficiency (no performance issues),

     Actual Hours = Earned Hours

so,

     Variance   = (Earned Hours x Budget Rate) - (Earned Hours x Actual Rate)
                = Earned Hours x (Budget Rate - Actual Rate)

Out at 1400.
