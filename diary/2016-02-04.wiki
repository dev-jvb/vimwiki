Arrive 0730. 
Paid AmEx and Chase cards from People's Bank account. 
Attended weekly meeting for 107483. John Clair was very clear that we are to follow the prescribed project processes and intends to go to Screening Committee on 2/15 or 3/7. (Likely the latter as there are still unresolved scope items.) 
Provided Tim with Charge Codes for the week. 
Out at 1645.
