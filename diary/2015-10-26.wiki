Prepared 105483 CN5 for issue to client.

Updated Progres Tracking for WE 10/23.

Attended meeting with Kevin to discuss engineering metric reporting (1.5 hours)

Rolled 105483 CN5 into Progress Tracker.

Processed PO for 107473/02167.

Reviewing totals in TIC Estimating tool for 107164, found discrepanices between what is in TICE and what is in PSE. There were last-minute, post-issue revisions by Procurement and Structural that changed the values in PSE. Re-exported PSE and re-imported to TICE. Talked with Bill Horak about TICE issues with factored amounts and Escalation/Contingency. There does not appear to be a place in TICE where one can see the TIC. How is that possible?

Created CN4.1 on 106817 for Piping hours as Trend per Harv. Rolled into Progress Tracker and marked as 100% complete. Rolled CN4 into PT as Approved Change.

Re-assigned 106888 and 107049 from Harv to Ron Peterson as PL at Harv's request. Notified Paul.

Explored SAM tool. Noted that the sign on the variance value seems reversed. Milestones with schedule/actual dates AFTER the BL date show a POSITIVE variance. Seems like it should be NEGATIVE. Sent note to Kevin.

Out at 1630.
