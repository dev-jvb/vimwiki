Arrive 0745.
Met with Geoff and Dan Lewis to discuss CompRate report.
	Dan will provide a monthly snapshot of BIT.
	Each month's snapshot will append to the data set to prvide the rolling 12 month history.
	All cum data will be from 4/1/18 forward (contract cumulative.)
	Hope is that the report can be generated from BIT (and maybe Vision) data.
	Dan noted that the onsite discount doesn't get applied until amounts are in Vision. So will need Vision data to get on-site billing amounts correct.
For 108229 monthly reporting package, need to include an 030 report.
Worked on CompRate workbook.
Out at 1630.
