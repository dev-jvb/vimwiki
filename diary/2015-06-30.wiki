Discussed state of affairs wrt budgets and $ on 415 with Ron. He will discuss with Werner.

Contacted Cynthia re funding for Interconnects. The FRFS has been generated and is awaiting Mark's signature. Mark will not be in the office until Thursday.

Per Ron, he will be the PoC for $ issues on BRPC. Requested CN for the following:
	Composite Rate Variance
	Schedule Change LoE
	VFD Change last week (HVAC)
	Potential revision to CN21
Ron thinks there should be enough here to make up the cost overage.

Prepared cost reports. Seems to be an issue with the report for 107278 wherein Tim Wright's hours for 6/26 are getting doubled up. Needs further investigation.

Out at 1630.
