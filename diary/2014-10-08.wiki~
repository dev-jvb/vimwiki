Arrive 0700.

Met with Justin and Brent to discuss resource needs primarily on OTPEX. Joined by Joe Schramer to discuss CSYS Designer needs (Brent wants 1 more.) Later joined by Dave Cunningham to discuss HVAC issues. ANC and BHM HVAC crews have not agreed on design philosophy; no additional HVAC designers are avialble in ANC or BHM. Brent to follow up with Dave Smith.

Worked on a layout to show Module Fabrication drivers. Reviewed with Anna. She would like something similar for IFR/IFF drivers.

Received call from Ken Garcia expressing concern about lateness of module fabrication (Pigging Module.)Explained that module fabrication is being driven by arrival of materials at the fabricator, so long-lead items are pushing fabrication out. Later conversationw ith Justin re same issue. Justin noted that if we were to expedite the items holding the module fabrication out, material need dates would come left. Noted that it's all a guess until we have POs out. Justin noted that we need to be careful not to publicize dates that might cause disciplines to lift off the gas.

 Whatever be your goal, 
 Keep your eye upon the donut 
 And not upon the hole"
 
Worked on updating VDDR worksheet for Anna.

Anna forwarded a request from Don Redick for a milestone Schedule showing IFFs for each WP with Variance sincle last update. Plan to include this in the performance reporting package. Worked on a layout for this request.

Attended Caelus coordination telecon with Brent, Mike and Ron. OTPEX has a 90% review in their Schedule only for the north slope construction package. They will be adding 60% model reviews similar to those on NDS-1. Ron noted that ANC is using the EHTC tool to forecast their manpower needs. Need to look at this and compare to the Schedule loading and resolve vars.
