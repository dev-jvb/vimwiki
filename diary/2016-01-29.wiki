Arrive 0800. 
Imported TIC Estimate to APEX with Tim on 107431. 
Reviewed timesheet with Tim and provided a list of jobs for chargin this week. Tim is OK with 32s if need be. Might be something to discuss with Kevin if Cascadia is struggling to fill his plate. 
Unlocked 107431 P4-7 PSE CN for Harv. Log discussion with Harv and Geoff about post-IFU estiamte revisions. TLDR version: it's not a big deal and until Anvil is responsible for management of TIC, it is not necessary for our numbers to align. Perhaps I am trying to invoke more rigor than needed at this time. RELAX, IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE. 
Opened third subjob, 303, under 107283 at request of Scott Hackett. 
Out at 1300.
