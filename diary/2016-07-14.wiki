Issued Committed Cost Report.
Worked with Angie a bit on the Quarerly Resource forecast. There seems to be too much EHTC in the system. This could be due to over-budgeting or under-statusing. Perhaps coincidenally, there were 400 hours of time charges to various projects with no corresponding earned hours last week. These 12.5 FTEs (it was the holiday week) very closely match the EHTC overage.
Out at 1630. Bound for M&Ds.
