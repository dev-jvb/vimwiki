Attended 105787 project meeting. Derek was on the phone, unable to deep dive the schedule/hours. Paul to set a meeting with the Control Systems team (and me) for tomorrow to discuss/develop a recovery plan. Derek did say that 90% compelte by 6/29 was not going to happen. So, the work scheduled to be complete by 6/29 doesn't really need to be complete by 6/29?
