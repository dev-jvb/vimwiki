Arrive 0800.

If I may, it has been my experience that bad news never gets better with age. I am concerned about the client’s reaction when, 2 days before the planned IFF date, we tell them we are going to push a week (or more?)

Do we have a final ISO count?

Based on consultation with Dave Smith, transferred 50 hours of his Engineering time to Designer.

Per Chris, iso count is 67. They will be checked in BLI. Chris will try to find out who is checking.

Out at 1630.
