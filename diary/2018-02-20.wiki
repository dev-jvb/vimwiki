Closed 108464.400 at Harv's request.
Reviewed internal forecast with Paul. Seems high at 100+ FTEs. Paul discussing with Geoff.
Attended 105787 weekly team meeting. i'm concerned about the untracked nature of FCN issue dates. Also, Electrical is lagging on checking. They are not working to the schedule specifically, more workin gon everything all at once. Showing no concern that others use the scheudle to plan their work and are relyin on them to meet their dates for specific pieces of the work. (Same old story wrt schedule.) One wonders if the WGs ever look at the schedule.
