Voicemail from Ron. There may be additional work needed due to decision to use TriMetal exhaust fans. Per Ron, the client original directed us to use Huntair/Cook instead of TriMetal. The client has now reversed that decision and wishes to use TriMetal. If accurate, this is legitimate change.

Meeting with Walter Michelutti. Very concerned about overage. On-going issue on multiple projects in ANC. Concerned about Ron's ability to close. Concerned about absence of accountability to budgets.

Worked to identify how many hours to hold until we can have a conversation with the client. Identified $10k as the amount to hold. (See spreadsheet at R:\BRPC\Reference\Project Controls\Amount to Hold from June Invoice.xlsx) for amounts and sources. Note that there is an unexplained discrepancy of $10k between Reporting and Billing. Reviewed this with Justin.

Werner has flagged $10.5k to be held from June invoice. Further discussion to be held for the July invoice.

Out at 1530.
