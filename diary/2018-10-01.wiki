Visited by Tony Dvorachek re: 104239.549. Seems an instrument originally planned to use 24V power was incorrectly ordered and now needs 120V power. Matisse Stevens indicate dthat Rob Holliman had directed her to work it out last week. However, this is the same PO that LAkiesha Hampton advised should not get any October charges. Emailed Lakiesha to let her know.
Out at 1630.
