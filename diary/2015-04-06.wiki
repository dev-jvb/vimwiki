Arrive 0715.

Spotted a reporting anomaly. Discussed with Kevin Formway. Let things settle down on Mondays and see if the issue persists. Also briefed Kevin on the events surrounding the missed M&C on Module 65. He did not have any best practice advice on SJ vs Job. He considers it a judgement call for the Project Leadership.

Discussed Heather Marshburn's OT with Craig Wilson. Craig feels that this should be addressed by the PL in the Billing Instructions. Heather is lobbying to made exempt and so the OT issue is a point in her favor. However, per Craig, there are other legal issues that may preclude that, so bes to leave it in the PLs hands and address it with Billing Instructions.

Discussed Jobs v Sub Jobs with Ron and agreed to open new jobs for Chem Injection and VFD modules. Thinking is that there is little commonality with Power Generation modules in 107315, so separate jobs are appropriate. Also, Rom believes that the missing M&C is already incorporated into CNs 1 and 2.

Attended Team meeting.
	Bill Scott not in office and not able to access tracker until tomorrow. Assisted Cliff Freemen with updates to Progress Tracker.

Updated project performance workbooks with earned hours from PT. Can't trust reporting.

Chris noted that there were 2 hours charged each for Jeff Careltona and Bryan Olson to P4 during WE 2/13/15. WTF?

Out at 1700.
