Looks like there may be room for improvement in the Blowdown tank VDDR cycle; look at duration of bid tab activity. Also, don't think that the API Pump should be impacting the Module. Review with Anna/Brent. Brent suggested reducing the VDDR turn around fof the blowdown tank to 3w. For the team, we agreed to hold the current dates. Anna will communicate with Ben regarding the slides showing in the Schedule and that we are monitoring the VDDR situation closely.

Out at 1600.
