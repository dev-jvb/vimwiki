Arrive 0800 (Motorcycle day) 
Had Tim hide P3 and show P4, 5, and 7 on 105478 at Howard's request. 
Updated Progress Tracker through current week and respread hours in EHTC Forecasting. 
Recevied call from Dena looking for Monthly Engineering and Onsite Hours Report. I spaces it as I never received the file from Mary Shoemaker. Called Mary and it did not get done while she was out sick. Fortunately, Hannah saved a copy and I was able to produce the report quickly and get it sent out the distro. 
Tested Tim's workbook for assisted production of the monthly Cost Summary Sheets. Pretty slick. Would be nice if printing could be automated next. 
Setup new PO for 107433.400. 
Issued Monthly Reports to PLs for review. 
Asked Tim to set 106888 CN10 to approved and track in PSE. Then publish in PT. 
Out at 1630.
