Long debrief with Paul on events while I was out.
Much CN activity on 108229 CD.
Researched CN amounts on 108229 for Brent. He was looking for CNs to net out to zero budget impact. However, CN11 was excluded (at Brent's direction) from the calculation on the value of CN20; which was intended to net out the CNs to zero.
Prepared monthly report workbook for June.
