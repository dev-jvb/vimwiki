Arrive 0800. 
Researched POs for 107136.400 and .510 for Geoff. Each sub job has a separate PO. 
Updated Shell CN Summary to include 107225 CN7 as In Development. 
Prepared and issued Estimated accrual report for March. 
Published 107483 Trend CN and refresehd reporting snapshot. Asked Tim to re-run 014 report. 
Worked request from Harv/Mark Boger for Procurement data on 107430 and 107431. 
Struggled with APEX to identify the two components added by CN2. They each need to have a new MR created to populate the date fields. Sent Aaron Rockwell a note asking why the existing data does not flow into the PPP. I hate APEX; and I am not alone. I believ ethat it will fail as a tool because it is so ungainly and difficult to use with any efficiency. Perhaps it does too much and needs to be scaled back or split into multiple, more-focused tools. It just shouldn't be so damn difficult to use and understand.
