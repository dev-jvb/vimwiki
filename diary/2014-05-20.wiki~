Arrive at 0730.

Scuttlebut is that BP will be reducing on-site headcount. Anvil reduction in scope has already occurred.

Emailed NHDS Monthly Status Report for April 2014.

Piping checking manpower is tight for the summer. Need to keep an eye on 105949 schedule.

Per Bob Schmidt, BP has decreed that PipeFab shall fabricate all pipe spools for the 2015 TAR program. Impact to Anvil scope unclear. For 106139; JH Kelly will still perform the field install but will not be fabricating the spools. Baseline plan was to provide IFC package to JH Kelly and they would do fab and field install. Need to understand how PipeFab's involvement impacts that plan. Bob wants to discuss with Bill Chambers. More to come...

See below re: Modifications to Schedule Dates:

Louise,
Per our conversation we will make the following adjustments to the Project schedule activities and dates.

1.	90% Model Review 
        a.	The information and level of detail has not changed sufficiently from the 60% review on May 8th so there currently isn’t a need to hold another review.
        b.	Cancel 5.27.14 meeting and perform the next review at the IFA Review Meeting currently scheduled for Thursday, 6.26.14
        c.	If questions arise while you are on vacation (6.9 thru 6.25) we will request a meeting with persons that you will suggest.  (Likely Ryan, Helene, and possibly others.)

2.	P&ID and MOC Update and Sign-off
        a.	Schedule shows 6.9.14, (while you are on vacation)
        b.	There are currently very few items on the list and those that are anticipated are minor “housekeeping and coordination” items
        c.	Therefore the next MOC review will be performed at the same time as the IFA Review meeting on 6.26.14.

Bob
