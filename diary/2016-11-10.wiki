"Project control is a continuous process that involves the following functions:
1. Monitoring work progress
2. Comparing it with the baseline schedule and budget (what they were supposed to be)
3. Finding any variances, determining where they are and the extent of the variances, and analyzing them to discover the causes
4. Taking corrective action whenever and wherever necessary in order to bring the project back on schedule and within budget."
