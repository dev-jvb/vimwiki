Arrive 0800.

Began assembling cost reports.

Met with Kevin Formway to discuss PC Lead opportunity in ANC. Discussed how family needs would make a permanent move problematice. Allowed that I would be willing to consider a rotation type of position.

Completed compilation of weekly cost reports.

Prepared summary of funding position on 107315.415 for Ron, Heather and Werner. Getting CN16 (Trend for additional ISOs funded would make us whole.)

Updated Consolidated Change Log to reflect approved change and revised funding needs. Emailed to CSG with cc: Ron Otero, Mike Moora and Werner Plagge.

Briefly met with Walter Michelutti. He inquired as to how concerned Mike and Werner are. Allowed that I did not get many calls from them with questions; so it's difficult to gauge their level of concern. Walter also hinted that BRPC may be a bit behind in their payables.

Out at 1705.
