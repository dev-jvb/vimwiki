Arrive 0800.

At direction of Caelus, we are to cancel WP0020,21 and 22.
	Remaining Budgets (dollars from Cost Report, Hours from PT):
		WP0020 - $100143, 2429 - 1460 = 969 hours
		WP0021 - $106648, 1859 - 916 = 943 hours
		WP0022 - $71694, 856 - 114 = 742 hours
Discussed with Justin. Concluded that we should give back the difference between the Pending Budget Dollars and tke Actual $ from the cost report. (Less the value of the hours needed to complete the associated MRs.)	

Direction from Ben to allow Control Room WP to continue to slide until GIS gets data to Anvil.

Out at 1630.
