Emailed NDS-1 Outstanding MR report to discipline leads per Brent Belsher request.

Discussed need for updated funding docs with Ron, Heather, Werner and Chris. Worked on Condensed Program Change Log to support funding request. Much help from Justin on background calcs and assumptions.

Heather declined to provide updated narratives for the weekly cost reports. She advised that I should proceed with issuing the reports. Finalized reports, had Justin do peer review and issued to the client.

Discussed updates to client fundign with Erik. Agreed that we would not update CF until we have revised funding docs in hand.

Out at 1645.
