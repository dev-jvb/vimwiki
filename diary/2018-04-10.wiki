Updated S-Curve for 105787.
Attended weekly meeting for 105787. Noted that CSYSD was weak on tracking last week. Bill Stuckey estiamtes actual overrun to be closer to 500 hours and not the 888 currently shown in reporting.
Spoke with Dena re: 108229. Due to the size of the CD project, a project-specific Outline Agreement is needed so that the value of the CD project does not impact the existing Outline Agreement. Result may be a change to the PO moving funding from Line 100 to Line 200. She hopes to have this done by the end of the week. Need to not enter the invoice until resolved.
Opened Piping Engineer charge element for 105787 P5. Tony Ma request, Harv approved.
Continued to prepared Q1 report. Picke dup comments from Geoff on Eng % TIC worksheet.
