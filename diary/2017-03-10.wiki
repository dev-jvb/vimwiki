Arrive 0800.
Entered remaining February invoices.
Had a "testy" conversation with Mark Boger wrt to PO increases for on-site work:
	Mark: "Why are you requesting and increase?"
	Me: Because Amber charged 50 hours to the job last month and there is not enough left to cover it.
	Mark: How much more does she have to do?
	Me: (Thinking, why would I know that?) It's client directed work.
	Mark: So?
	Me: Ok. I'll email Amber.
Sent email to Amber to ask how much more work she has to go. Also charged 0.5 hours to the job for chasing it down. Discussed with Geoff and he agreed that MArk should know how much is left. I concluded that Mark is just an a$$.
Prepared and approved my time sheet.
Approved Paul's timesheet.
Out at 1300.
