Arrive 0915.

Discussed PMAC budget on Mustang with Justin. Justin feel strongly that we should hold to ~20%. The project is very schedule driven and therefore merits the attention. Also, need some clarity on what PMAc service BRPC will require/desire.

Seems BRPC has descoped the project to a single module. May be no need for scheduler and minimal for Project Controls. So much for that life boat. Now what?

Met with Brent. For Caelus Restart Schedule, Brent would like to see modules listed and staggered plus lone lead items by module. I think I'm going to have to do this in P6. Turning into more than I thought. Built a schedule for NDS-1; enlisted Chris to do same for OTPEX.

Out at 1515.
