conversationw ith Harv Aujla re 107225 Control systems tracking. George Dancosik has been reporting progress as % of budget used; not % of work completed. (This is a new one to me.) Harv asked that I force a reporting update to capture the revisions. Following reporting update I re-ran 006 report to compare before and after. Difference swung project from a projected overage to an underrun. 
Conversation with Angie leads me to believe that George's practice may have its roots in the Cascadia program. How is it that these processes are not standardized across programs?
