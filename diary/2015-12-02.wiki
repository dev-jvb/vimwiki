Process PO increase for PO 4512398277; JN 102698.198. 
Revised PRINT$ to PRINT for 107550 per Geoff Latimer direction. 
Continued validation of 107433 TIC estimate. Found what Jim and I think is a miss related to the ~$15k freight on electrical equipment in EBS 2. Found issue with 107433 APEX not matching TIC. In TIC, Data ID #60879, came into APEX with Contractor Labor and Contractor Material but lacking Owner Material cost. Values are in TIC Estimating tool, but did not all import into APEX. I added a line in APEX to capture the Owner Material, then everything came into alignment. 
Prepared and sent the Monthly Estimated Engineering and Onsite Hours workbook. 
Discussed multiple on site dates in the schedule vs dates in APEX with Paul. Expect more to come on this after Geoff discusses with Pete Allred. 
Discussed my attendance at initial schedule interactive/review meetings with Paul. Agreed that 107433 is too far gone and will be released as is. Jim Holien's 107258 project is next up.
