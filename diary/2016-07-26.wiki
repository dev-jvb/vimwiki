Discussed plans for rate differential trend on 107162 with Dena, Howard and Geoff (separately.) All agreed to trend savigns on actual hours through 7/22. Geoff is of a mind to not trend if we are within 10% of our estimate and not until we are >80% complete. Prepared the CN and sent to Howard for review/comment.
Reviewed EHTC Forecasting. Looks like Buyer has declined significantly since the quarterly report. Perhaps Jimmy redistributed some hours?
