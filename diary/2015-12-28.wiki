Arrive 0815 via Uber. Dropped off warranty return phone at Burlington UPS center. Dropped 4Runner at Bellingham Les Schwab. 
Reviewed, approved and prepared Change Logs for 107164 CN 10.2 and 11; 105483 CN 6.1. 
Prepared estimating accrual report for December. Note that the month end is 12/25; so no ratio applied to projected hours. 
Per Brian at Les Schwab; front rotors need to be re-machined (again.) Right front rotor especially bad. Should be under warranty. Also noted some seepage from right rear wheel bearing seal (not critical at this time.) 
Still working 107433 APEX import. There are difference between what was issued and what is in TICe. In EBS1, there is Civil/Site CFM of $6115 listed in what was issued that does not appear in TICe. GRRRR. Several issues wremain with EBS2; but I got EBS3 to align, so that's something. 
Out at 1715.
