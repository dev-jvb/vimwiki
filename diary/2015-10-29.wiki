Arrive 0730.

Imported TIC Estimate into APEX for 107162. Per Howard, MR Groups are set in TICE.

Documented my understanding of high-level TICe/APEX workflow to Kevin.

At Harv's requested, opened 107225.300 to charges for all groups.

Vanessa Gray is working on filling in missing account codes in 107164 estimate.

Attended Merrill Lynch presentation on retirement plans.

Talked to Jim Holien about rate and pricing on 107164. Settled on 283k for P4-7. I updated the APP cover letter.

Talked to Alison Hester re MR creation in APEX. After importing the TIC Estimate into APEX, one must create a new MR for each MR Group. (The disciplines should do this as they need to provide need dates, lead times, etc.)

Discussed 107483 with Paul Duersch. Sounds like the client is pushing us to roll right into P4 to save time. Driving to an April 1construction start; really a pinch with Procurement.

Howard noted that freight line items (and itme swiht no MR Group assigned.) were imported into APEX.
