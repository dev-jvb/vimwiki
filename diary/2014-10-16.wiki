Arrive 0730.

Reversed EQUI changes in schedule.

Produced NDS-1 and PGP schedule artifacts for Performance Report.

Met with Dennis McGrew and Diana Dillman re HVAC Engineer hours and tracking. Tom to redistribute remaining budget among 4 modules. Remaining HVAC/E work boils down to vendor doc reviews and a few drawings. 

Assisted Chris with updating % Complete in OTPEX schedule.

Developed a high-level SPI calculation for NDS-1 and OTPEX. Based on cumulative planned and earned through last monthly report (end of September.)

        NDS-1 SPI = EV / PV = 25797 / 27376 = 0.94
        OTPEX SPI = 23708 / 29853 = 0.79

Discussed with Brent the problems associated with SPIs in general. Including that non-resourced activities don't have neither PV nor EV and so could be critcally late with no indication in the SPI.  (Among other issues.)

Brent also mentioned that Quyen has requested a progress curve for PGP; which is in P3, so not sure how meaningful that would be. tom to take a stab at it.

Sent out a table of CPIs and SPIs to Project Leaders for comment in tomorrow's report.

Out at 1730.
