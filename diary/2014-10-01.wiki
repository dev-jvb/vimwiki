Schedule Update Notes by WP

WP0008 - Chemical Injection Module

Improvement in IFR date due to correction of schedule logic.

WP0011 - 35kV Transformer Platform

We were expecting the Bid Tab Review to be complete 9/15. It was not and is still in Anvil's engineer's hands. It has now slid to at least 10/8 per Marty Olson. This is driving out the receipt of vendor drawings which are impacting the IFR date. Mobile equipment requirement were not in the basis of design. This has resulted in additional time to fully develop the transformer specification. Vendor response has been slow. XFormer could be shipped to NDS-1 and set on platform anytime.

WP0012 - 35kV Switchgear Module

IFR is being driven by VDDR for the Switchgear. QTS was sent ot Caelus for final approval 9/30. Kent estimated 1 week for Caelus to issue a PO once QTS is approved. This puts the PO at ~10/8.

Out at 1700.
