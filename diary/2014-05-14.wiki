Back on site at BP. Need to create PRs that reference the WOs created yesterday.

Need to know dollars for each line item of the PR. $75k each per Paul.

Also need to know Order Unit for each. Use LOT (LO)

Unable to save PR line item; get system message:
        BMXZZ0095E - Workorder should be active. (The WOs are all WAPPR.)
        
Had to cycle back through WOs and set Status to PLAN to enable them to be added to the PR.

Two PRs entered with 39 line items each:
        324037 - Thermography Inspection
        324081 - Other Inspection Services

Each line item is $75k

Now need to create 38 WOs for Routine CUI Inspections. (Same as others but exclude Electrical Vaults.)

Created 38 additional WOs for "Routine CUI Inspections."

Created a PR for the Routine CUI Inspection WOs.

Paul to develop a list of additional WOs needed and get back to me for additional work.
