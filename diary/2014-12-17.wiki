Arrive 0800.

Stopped at College Way Animal Hospital to get referrals for placing Shae. They suggested contacting the Humane Society first. Also provided contact number for SPOT; 360-336-5388.

Called Skagit Valley Humane Society. They advised that they could not accept surrender of an "aggressive" dog due to liability concerns. They recommended euthanasia; specifically Cedardale Spay and Neuter.

Updated all MRs in Schedule to align with IPDMS. Had Tom look over my shoulder for familiarization with the process.

Updated Graphic schedule per Anna's markups.

Reviewed schedule variances. Need to chase down vars on packages 0008, 0010 and 0011.

Out at 1730.
