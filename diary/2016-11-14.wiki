Received Annual Merit increase. $245/month (2.7%) Kevin mentioned that Gordy Lindell sees Project controllers as little more than clerks; so value not high (how's that for motivational?). Also, Kevin was told not to take into consideration that it had been 2 years since the last increase. Increase effective 12 November 2016. Very disappointed. Geting tired of working where what I do is not taken seriously. Time to start looking elsewhere?
Discussed inclusion of Contingency in CNs with Harv. Also discussed with Justin. Sent an email to Pete Allred requesting guidance. Leaning toward only including in CNs that are changes to field scope; not Trends to the project.
Prepared CN4 documents for 107767. Need to resolve handling of Contingency in CNs and on the Change Log.
Uploaded Monthly Reports to SharePoint.
Closed 10708 in anticipation of PO Closure per email from Greg Lykke.
Out at 1630.
