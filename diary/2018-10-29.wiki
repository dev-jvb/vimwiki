Met with Harv to discuss funding on 108237. Need to dig deeper to determine if a PO increase is needed. Researched this and found that we never received full execute funding. Bringin the funding into alignment with our Approved budget would resolve any shortfalls and then some.
Closed 108702 P3 and P4 per Harv's request.
Archived PSE on 108725 at Geoff's request.
Setup PSE for Stanley Gross to enter remaining budgets for on-site projects.
