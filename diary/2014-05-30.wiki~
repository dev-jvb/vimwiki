Arrive 0730.

* [ ] Update 105949 schedule. After recovering pre_DD baseline, mistakenly deleted original project; including all prior BLs. After discussing the issue with Jim Eaton and Scott Horne, it was decided to let it ride until Monday when the project can be restored by BP. At that time, make the schedule updates as needed. Discussion with Jim Maruska led to conclusion that we should let the schedule ride as is (on track) and see what Monday's conference call brings.
* [X] Update 106438 schedule. IFC has slid 1d to 7/16. Breaking 7/15 constraint. Driven by delays in getting engineering info from Pentair.
