Arrive 0730.

Worked schedule to incorporate comments from Mirek. Added an IFF release toe WP 020 and 021 to address need to release fabrication drawings to the well house fabricator in advance of the IFC release. #106726

Met with Brent, Anna, Brian Baker and Brady Jensen to discuss potential change sin the NDS-1 site plan. Quyen appears to be directing a return to the original, permitted gravel layout. This would cause revisions to the site plan. Brent will set up a conference call to confirm Caelus request and identify scope of change required to implement. #106726

Brent also mentioned that Caelus is changing the well count (again.) Now they are indicating 40 wells. #106726

Procurement Schedule Updating
