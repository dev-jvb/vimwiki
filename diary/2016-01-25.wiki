Arrive 0730. 
Approved time sheets for Angie and Paul. 
Fielded call from Anita at SPSR inquiring about PO 4514187445 (Anvil 104609.111). There will soon be a new PO to cover 2016 costs. Advised that December costs have been submitted (she confirmed seeing the invoice in their systems.) Advised that Janaury cost would be entered in mid-February. New PO is working it's way through approvals. Will hopefully be in place prior to invoicing January costs. If not, there is still quite a bit left on the current PO. 
Opened 107726 P4 at Derek Thompson's request. 
Processed PO revisions for 104239.502. 
Welcomed Tim Bennett to the team.
