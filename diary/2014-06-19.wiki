Attended WebTPA Presentation.

Delivered EVM Presentation to BP Project Controls team.

Need to understand the value of physically progressing the schedule. My sense is that the logic compromises necessary are diluting the value of the schedule. Unless, we forego correction of the out of sequence issues.

105451 - Revised CN117 to include ROM field/Equipment costs. Updated schedule. Consolidated PSV deliveries are busting the TAR Procurement on-site constraint.

106726 - discussion with Justing regarding physical progress complete reporting in the schedule. Conclusion was to stay the course, report physical percent complete and adjust logic and durations as needed to maintain the finish dates.

Brief review of Cost report. Strategy to resolve overruns; Reduce Piping & HVAC EHTC in WP414. Status PA and PL to 1.0 using a rate adjustment. More to come in the morning.

Schedule is ready for DD move; saved pre DD Move baseline and XER.

Out at 1700.
