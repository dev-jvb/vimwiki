Met with CSYS (Ken Swalley, Ken Garcia, Joe Schramer, Richard Martinez) and Electrical (Erik Jonson, Cesar Salire, Mark Ridenhour) to discuss staffing. CSYS staffing is OK; Ken Garcia expressed concern about getting HVAC deliverables. Erik Jonson is confident that current Electrical staffing is adequate to meet schedule issue dates. Did question whether or not post-IFF hours (for FAT, drawing reviews, etc.) are properly represented in the schedule.

Updated %Complete and Remaining Units in schedule in anticipation of schedule update.

Updated IFF schedule with deadline dates for getting docs to PA.
