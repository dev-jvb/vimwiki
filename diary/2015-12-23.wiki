Talked to Howard about APEX on 107554. Gerry Thompson entered items (prematurely?) last week. These will be replaced when the estimate is imported. Need to contact Gerry to see what his intent was.
Confirmed with Jim Eaton that it is not necessary to have MR Groups define din APEX prior to import; only reason to do this is if early procurement is needed.
