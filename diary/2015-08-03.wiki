Question on 107431: Geoff's direction to Bill was to show P3 starting in late August. However the forecast workbook includes a P2 that starts in September; did Geoff really mean P3 in August or did he mean P2? Sent email to Geoff. Geoff clarified that he did mena P3, P2 will be skipped. Workbook is correct.

Out at 1730.
