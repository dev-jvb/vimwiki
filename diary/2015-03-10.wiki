Arrive 0730.

At the request of Mike Moora, sent email to Cynthia Geiermann, BRPC Project Controls, to introduce myself and begin conversation about reporting expectations.

Per Justin, there may be some confusion wrt BRPC. Kevin Formway believes that I was submitted as a primary for the Calgary position and secondary for the P4 engineering position. Need to confirm with Brent that I was submitted for Calgary. So, Calgary may not yet be off the table after all. Confirmed with Brent that I was submitted for the Calgary position. Justin was submitted for the P4 PC Lead position.

NDS-1 Restart Schedule Assumptions
	* First Oil is 6/1/2017.
	* Durations from Module Fab complete to First Oil are per previous schedule.
	* Module Fabrication duration is based on a 6 month duration for completion of all modules. assumes starting module fabrication over from start. Also assumes Module Fabrication does not begin until all procured materials are on-ist eat fabricator. (Per discussionwith Justin Allyne.)
	* Procurement Lead time is the longest lead time of unpurchased materials.
		* 24 weeks for NDS-1 (per Mike Dyer & Kent Charette)
		* 50 weeks for OTPEX (Production Seperator, per Mike Dyer & Kent Charette) Per Brent, the Production Separator does not impact module fabrication as it ships direct to slope. Next longest lead is:
			* Standby Generator
	* Estimate 4 weeks for Procurement restart (need time to request and recieve updated quotes.)

Out at 1730.
