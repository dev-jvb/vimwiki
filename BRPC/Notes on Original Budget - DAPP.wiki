Conference call with Mike Moora and Heather Marshburn re BRPC Module 63 DAPP. Expressed concern about PMAC being light on hours. Provided assumptions in PSE tool outlining minimal PMAC support commensurate with number of hours budgeted. Mike's general position was that the budget is what it is and he is not amenable to upward revisions. Indicated the BRPC had already signed off on the budget (no idea at what rate it was bid.)
