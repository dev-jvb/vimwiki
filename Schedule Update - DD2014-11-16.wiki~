== NDS-1 Schedule Update Summary for DD 11/16/2014 ==

This update cycle included a re-organization of the work package release dates. At the client's direction, IFR release for most of the work packages were eliminated. This enable some recovery of the IFF release dates to be nearer to the Anvil August IFA dates. Also reflected in the schedule is the client's commitment to a 1 week review period for any remaining IFR packages. These revisions are addressed in Anvil CN21. 

Also at the client's direction, individual material on-site dates were de-linked from the module fabrication activities and are no longer driving module fabrication. Milestones representing "All Materials On-site at Fabricator" were added to the schedule. Per client direction, these milestones are constrained to finish 6 weeks after package IFF. These milestones, listed below, will indicate negative float when material on-site dates do not satisfy the constraint date. As additional material procurement items are added to the schedule, the associated on-site dates will be linked to these module milestones.
