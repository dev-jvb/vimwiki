From the Anvil Code of Ethics:
1. Record all hours worked daily 
2. Do not average your time between days or projects 
3. Always charge correct projects for time worked 
4. Do not allow others to change time for you in our timekeeping systemâ€“it is your personal responsibility.


Thou shalt charge thy time to the job/subjob/wbs where you are working.
Thou shalt distribute thy overtime in over all of thy jobs in equal measure to thy regular time.
Thou shalt not over-report thy progress.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's budget, nor their CPI.
Thou shalt not work on new scope without an approved Change Notice.
Delay not thy progress tracking lest ye feel the wrath of the Project Controller.
Own the inputs.
communication is what the listener does.
